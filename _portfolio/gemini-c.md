# Gemini C
Spring 2017

This blanket's design focuses on comfort in an exposed state & bringing beauty to being supportive of oneself. Gemini C was produced for the Summer School Collective’s summer poster show, “Comfort; A poster show but with blankets” that took place at Consign Design in Seattle, WA on September 8th, 2017.

Summer School Collective started in the summer of 2015 at Cornish College of the Arts. The goal was to provide a space for people to pursue their personal projects alongside others in an effort to preserve the many benefits of creating within a community. What started as simply meeting regularly to share work and get critique has grown to include curation of shows, and publishing.
