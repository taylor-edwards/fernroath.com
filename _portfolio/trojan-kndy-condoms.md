“Suck on Something Sweet.” If Trojan released a new line of condoms, what would they be? I focused on non-traditional flavors for creative couples. Using as little material as possible I created a small, easy-access packaging for those who need protection and fun on the go. KNDY (KANDY) is a variety pack of the three flavors “Birthday Cake,” “Rock Candy” and “Peach Ring.”

This project was featured in the Cornish College of the Arts Product & Packaging Show in 2015 and on [the Dieline](http://www.thedieline.com/blog/2015/4/15/30-condoms-we-wish-were-real).
