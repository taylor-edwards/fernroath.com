Guild Week was an advertisement campaign to promote the upcoming card set, Guilds of Ravnica, the third major set addition of 2018 to the world famous trading card game, Magic: The Gathering. To rally up players, I created light and dark variants of each advertisement using original artwork while following brand guidelines. The deliverables included social media assets such as headers and icons. All assets were localized into eleven languages and were displayed internationally on many platforms including Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.
