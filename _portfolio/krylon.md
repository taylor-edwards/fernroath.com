Saving the world one color at a time with “Honey, Honey”, “Basil” and “Sugar Cane”. For this project Krylon released a new line of spray paint in which we designed from the bottom up. My concept was a nature friendly spray paint that played off of color connections. I created a simple design that was to the point and would never confuse you on what color spray paint you were getting and was endorse with the insect that most matched that color/name.
