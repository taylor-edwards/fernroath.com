Saving the world one color at a time with “Honey, Honey,” “Basil” and “Sugar Cane.” For this project Krylon hypothetically released a new line of spray paint which I designed from the bottom up. My concept was a nature friendly spray paint that played off of natural color connections. I created a simple design that was to the point and would never confuse a buyer on which color spray paint he was buying. Each can is paired with a color-inspired insect.

This project was featured in the Cornish College of the Arts Product & Packaging Show, 2015.
