Friday Fruits is a study of a faux cannabis dispensary & itâ€™s products. This project includes logo design, packaging and illustration to help give a clean, kind feel. The three icons represent times of day and the generic feels of Sativa dominant (circle), Indica dominate (triangle) and hybrids (hexagon).
