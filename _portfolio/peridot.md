Peridot is an illustrated conceptual spring line of gender free clothing which promotes confidence, comfort and protection.

This project started with the idea that everyone should be able to feel confident and comfortable in his or her own skin. With looks inspired by the Pacific Northwest and young Seattleites, these croquis and patterns bear a fresh spring look.

Peridot is a line that anyone, any gender or sex can wear. It’s up to you; do you like it? Wear it – it’s that simple. Feel confident, comfortable and protected both physically and mentally in your own skin.
