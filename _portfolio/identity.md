Identity is the rebranding & redesign of my professional portfolio. I worked with aspects of design that Iâ€™ve often felt intimidated by while exploring my own personal strengths that I wanted future clients to experience while looking through my work. This site was designed from the base up and developed by Taylor Edwards.

Total site redesign coming soon.
