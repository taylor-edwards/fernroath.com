Semiotic and season focused project. I chose to make a “trendy” and elegant dress that could be worn in summer and fall. The dress is made to wear from the remnants of a dress bra that can be adjusted for comfort. The shapeless matched with the neckline allow for a graceful and flattering dress. Made with all recycled material and hand sewn.
