I made a trendy and elegant dress that could be worn in summer and fall. The dress is made from the remnants of a dress bra which can be adjusted for comfort. The shapelessness of the fabric matched with the neckline allows for a graceful and flattering flow with the body. Hand sewn with all recycled material.
