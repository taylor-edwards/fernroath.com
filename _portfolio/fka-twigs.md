The premise of this project was to create a gig poster for an artist or musician. In wanting to design a poster for FKA Twigs, I wanted to capture both the elegance and the curiosities which she evokes with her music. This is an 18Ã—24" three layer handmade screen print created with the collector audience in mind. TYPE A is an elegant version and TYPE B captures a twist of curiosity.

This poster was featured in the Cornish College of the Arts Burn & Swipe Poster Show in 2015.
