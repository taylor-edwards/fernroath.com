18Ã—24 in hand screen printed poster. We were assigned one musician/band at random and had to create a venue poster for them. I was assigned FKA Twigs, an elegant artist that captivates all with a twist of strange in every peace of her music. This is a four layer screen print using overlay to create a third color. TYPE A is the elegant version and TYPE B is the twist of strange, created with the collector audience in mind.
