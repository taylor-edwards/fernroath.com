18Ã—24 hand screen printed poster. The assignment was to create a gig poster for a randomly selected artist/muscian in which I was assigned FKA Twigs. I wanted to capture both the elegance and the strange that she brings out with her music and videos. This is a four layer screen print using overlay to create a third color. TYPE A is the elegant version and TYPE B is the twist of strange, created with the collector audience in mind.
