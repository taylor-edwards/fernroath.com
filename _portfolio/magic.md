“MAGIC.” For this poster I was challenged to take a simple word and give it visual form. I derived my visuals from the more traditional magic of mixing herbs and old style tattoos. MAGIC is an 18×24" hand screen printed poster.

This poster was featured in Cornish College of the Arts "One-Word" Poster Show,2015 and Cornish College of the Arts Burn & Swipe Poster Show, 2015
