Self is the rebranding & redesign of my professional portfolio. I worked with aspects of design that Iâ€™ve often felt intimidated by while exploring my own personal strengths that I wanted future clients to experience while looking through my work. This site was designed from the base up and developed by Taylor Edwards.

Impressed with the implementation of this site? Check out the dev.
