Wizards of the Coast released the latest chapter to the Magic: The Gathering franchise as an open beta in September 2018. These advertisements needed to entice players from competing online card games along with existing Magic fans. I created site takeover skins and a suite of digital ads with original art while following brand guidelines for Magic: The Gathering Arena. Using composition and a clear call to action, I helped create a visually compelling hierarchy that drove new users to download and enter the world of Magic: The Gathering.
