      <h1>Fern Roath</h1>
      <p>Fern Roath was born in Spokane, Washington and grew up near the small city of Deer Park. She has been constantly illustrating from a young age. In high school, Fern started expanding her skills towards digital media by exploring what she thought was graphic design. She continued her love for illustration and design in 2012 at Cornish College of the Arts as a Visual Communications major. Four years later she has discovered her love for product packaging, photography, poster design, fashion design and much more. Fern has a sweet tooth, likes to cook, loves cats and can usually be found sketching something in her personal sketchbook.</p>
